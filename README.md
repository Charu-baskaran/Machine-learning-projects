# Housing Price Prediction with Feature Selection

This project uses the housing dataset to predict house prices using machine learning. 
It demonstrates the use of RandomizedSearchCV in a pipeline for hyperparameter tuning and incorporates a feature selection step in the preparation pipeline.



## Introduction
Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service during a certain time frame. 
Managing and reducing churn rate is crucial for businesses, as acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones.

This project aims to predict house prices using a machine learning model while incorporating RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and a feature selection step in the data preparation pipeline.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12.0
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

# Customer Churn Analysis using Cluster Analysis

This project focuses on understanding and analyzing customer churn in the Telco industry. 
Customer churn refers to the percentage of customers who stopped using a company's product or service during a specific period.

## Dataset: Telco-Customer-Churn
The dataset, "Telco-Customer-Churn," contains information about Telco customers, including various attributes such as customer demographics, services subscribed, contract details, and churn status.

## Why Customer Churn Matters
Customer churn is a natural aspect of business, but managing and reducing churn is crucial for the following reasons:
- **Costs:** Acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones.
- **Revenue Stability:** Retaining customers ensures a stable revenue stream.
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Understanding and addressing reasons for churn improves overall customer satisfaction.

## Objectives
1. **Identify Customer Clusters:** Utilize cluster analysis to group customers based on behavior and characteristics.
2. **Evaluate Churn Impact:** Examine the impact of different variables on customer churn within each cluster.
3. **Reduce Churn:** Develop strategies to reduce churn, tailored to each customer cluster.

## Steps to Reproduce Analysis
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Load the Telco-Customer-Churn dataset.
   - Explore and clean the data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Variable Impact Analysis:**
   - Investigate how various variables (e.g., contract type, monthly charges, customer satisfaction) affect customer churn.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into patterns and trends.

3. **Cluster Analysis:**
   - Apply cluster analysis algorithms (e.g., K-means clustering) to group customers based on behavior.
   - Evaluate the optimal number of clusters using appropriate techniques.

4. **Churn Reduction Strategies:**
   - Develop personalized churn reduction strategies for each cluster.
   - Consider targeted marketing, improved customer service, or tailored product/service offerings.

5. **Profile Customer Clusters:**
   - Create profiles for each customer cluster, highlighting key characteristics.
   - Understand the unique needs and preferences of each cluster.
