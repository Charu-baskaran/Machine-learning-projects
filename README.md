# Housing Price Prediction with Feature Selection

This project uses the housing dataset to predict house prices using machine learning. 
It demonstrates the use of RandomizedSearchCV in a pipeline for hyperparameter tuning and incorporates a feature selection step in the preparation pipeline.



## Introduction
Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service during a certain time frame. 
Managing and reducing churn rate is crucial for businesses, as acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones.

This project aims to predict house prices using a machine learning model while incorporating RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and a feature selection step in the data preparation pipeline.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12.0
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhirajnirne/california-housing-data


## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   
   jupyter notebook

2. Open the `mltt assignment(a).ipynb` notebook.

3. Execute the cells in the notebook to run the entire pipeline.

## File Descriptions
- `mltt assignment(a).ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for the project.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing information about the project ,dataset and usage.
